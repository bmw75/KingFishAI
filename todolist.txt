- General
	> Write a function that checks if an opponent's piece is trapped by our pieces in their home area.
		If this is the case then we can start ignoring one of our own pieces and use it as a defensive piece (because we now
		require one less piece in their home area in order to win).
	> Work on special marble black box

- A* Search
	> Make A* take into account placing special marbles by using the special marble black box.
	> Currently our A* only looks 5 moves ahead. Test with different amounts?
			If it's too big its a problem, because A* doesn't take into account opponent movement.
			E.g. looking ahead 10 moves was actually worse than just looking ahead 5 moves with A*.

- Alpha-Beta Search
	> Make AB search work with the special marble black box.

- Classification
	> Is there any way in which we can classify the opponent?
	> Depending on how he's classified, are there any counter-strategies?

- Learning
	> Figure out how to implement Machine Learning algorithms and collect data.
