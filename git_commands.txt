Git cheat sheet: help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/

What follows is just a list of things I found helpful:

Forking the repo (you already did this if you are capable of reading this file):
git clone git@github.com:jps327/KingFishAI.git

Then go into the folder that just got created:
cd KingFishAI
git remote add upstream git://github.com/jps327/KingFishAI.git
git fetch upstream

This will make your forked repo point back to the original KingFishAI repo.

IMPORTANT:
It is recommended (but certainly not essential) that you do not work straight from the master branch.
Always create new branches - branches are really helpful ways to test new things out.
That way you can go trying to implement lots of different things at the same time.

To create a branch and switch into it:
git checkout -b mybranch

To switch to a branch:
git checkout 

Once you've finished working on your branch and are ready to merge it back into the master branch:
git checkout master
git merge mybranch

Deleting a branch:
git branch -d mybranch

Pushing your changes into to the repo:
git push origin master

Pulling in changes from the original repo: (always do this if you suspect the original repo may have changed)
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
