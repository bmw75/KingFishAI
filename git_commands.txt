Git cheat sheet: help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/

What follows is just a list of things I found helpful:

Forking the repo (you already did this if you are capable of reading this file):
git clone git@github.com:jps327/KingFishAI.git

Then go into the folder that just got created:
cd KingFishAI
git remote add upstream git://github.com/jps327/KingFishAI.git
git fetch upstream

This will make your forked repo point back to the original KingFishAI repo.

IMPORTANT:
It is recommended (but certainly not essential) that you do not work straight from the master branch.
Create new branches - branches are really helpful ways to test new things out independently of each other.

To create a branch and switch into it:
git checkout -b mybranch

To switch to a branch:
git checkout 

Deleting a branch:
git branch -d mybranch

COMMITTING AND PUSHING CHANGES:
Committing changes (this does not yet push your changes to the original repo):
git commit -a

Once you've finished working on your branch and are ready to merge it back into your master branch:
git checkout master
git merge mybranch

Pushing changes into to the repo (so that the rest of us can pull these changes and see what you've done):
git push origin master

Pulling in changes from the original repo: (always do this if you suspect the original repo may have changed)
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

Making sure that changes on master appear in your current branch:
git rebase master
