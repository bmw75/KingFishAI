Forking the repo (you already did this if you are capable of reading this file):
git clone git@github.com:jps327/KingFishAI.git

Then go into the folder that just got created:
cd KingFishAI
git remote add upstream git://github.com/jps327/KingFishAI.git
git fetch upstream

This will make your forked repo point back to the original KingFishAI repo.
