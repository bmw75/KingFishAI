Always work from the AwesomeAI folder.

When you want to test your code, go into the release folder and run
./copyAI.sh or ./copyAndMakeAI in order to copy the files you modified
from AwesomeAI into release.

Then run ./runAwesome.sh in order to run our AI. You can see the results in
p1.log or game.log.  You can also quickly see who won by running ./whoWon.sh

REMEMBER:
Take a look into copyAI to see which are the files that get copied from AwesomeAI
into release. If you create a new class, or modified a new file then you'll want to
make sure that this file is being listed in copyAI.sh.

Also, added git_commands.txt where you can get helpful git shit.

Finally, to submit the AI into the server you need to create a tar gzip file.
Here be the magic command:
tar -cvzf kingFishAI.tar.gz release
